Hello, my name is Rahul Gupta. I’m a Full Stack Developer with 2 years of hands-on experience in PHP and Laravel, and over a year working with Node.js. I’ve worked on real-time web applications, implemented scalable CRUD functionalities, integrated APIs, and handled both frontend and backend tasks across live projects.

In Laravel, I’ve developed custom modules, optimized database queries with Eloquent, and managed middleware, authentication, and RESTful APIs. On the Node.js side, I’ve worked with Express.js, handled asynchronous logic, and built secure, fast server-side logic for various use cases.

I enjoy writing clean, maintainable code and love learning new tools that improve application performance. I've also collaborated with cross-functional teams, followed Agile practices, and contributed to real-time problem solving during product development.

Currently, I’m looking to grow further in a role where I can deepen my expertise in backend development, contribute to impactful projects, and continue learning advanced technologies.









Good morning/afternoon. My name is Rahul Gupta, and I’m a passionate Full Stack PHP Developer with over 2 years of experience, including extensive work on WordPress development. I’ve built and maintained more than 22 web applications, many of which involved WordPress-based solutions ranging from custom theme development and plugin customization to performance optimization and SEO improvements.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science and have previously worked at Gazick Private Limited, where I led a real estate PHP project, and I’m currently working at Sanglob Business Services, Pune, contributing to enterprise-level projects, including award sites and essay competition platforms.

In WordPress, I specialize in:

Creating custom themes and child themes

Developing and modifying plugins

Building responsive and secure websites

Integrating third-party APIs and payment gateways

Working with Elementor, WooCommerce, and ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)

I’m also familiar with front-end tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Tailwind, and I follow best practices for clean, optimized, and SEO-friendly code.

What excites me about WordPress is its flexibility and the community around it. I enjoy solving technical problems and turning client requirements into robust, scalable web solutions. I’m now looking forward to joining a team where I can continue to grow, take on new challenges, and contribute meaningfully to impactful projects.

Thank you for the opportunity.





In our current product development, we primarily use a Full Stack JavaScript approach. The frontend is built with React.js and Redux for state management, while the backend is handled with Node.js and Express.js. For mobile applications, we use React Native. Our database stack includes MongoDB and PostgreSQL, depending on the use case. We also leverage TypeScript, Docker, and Kubernetes for improved scalability and maintainability.

We do keep an eye on emerging technologies. The team evaluates new frameworks quarterly and adopts them when they add clear value in terms of performance, scalability, or developer productivity. For example, we recently started experimenting with Next.js for SSR and GraphQL for more efficient API handling in specific modules.
